## About
* In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. As a bonus task, you can program your app to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.  Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.

## Installation
* Clone the repository: https://github.com/csbistline/bamazon.git
* Run `npm install`

## How-to use this application
* Run from the command line. Type `node customer` or `node manager` to launch the customer or manager interface. Follow the on-screen prompts to view, buy or add items to inventory.
